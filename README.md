## Detailed Description:

### Movie Genre Classification:
1. Create a class for embedding the movie descripton using TF-IDF
2. This will help in processing the raw data which is projected from discrete natural language space to continous vector space
3. We will now use these vectors as features for classifying each movie into a particular genre.
